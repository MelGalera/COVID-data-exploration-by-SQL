COVID Data exploration using SQL
<br>
<br>

### PART A. Data preprocessing

```sql
/* check the number of rows (records) in the dataset */ 
SELECT count(*)
FROM coviddeaths;

/* add a new column date with datatype as date (the existing date column has a datatype of varchar) */ 
ALTER TABLE coviddeaths RENAME COLUMN "date" TO date_orig;
ALTER TABLE coviddeaths ADD COLUMN reporting_date date;
UPDATE coviddeaths SET reporting_date = TO_DATE(date_orig, 'DD/MM/YYYY');

ALTER TABLE covidvaccinations RENAME COLUMN "date" TO date_orig;
ALTER TABLE covidvaccinations ADD COLUMN reporting_date date;
UPDATE covidvaccinations SET reporting_date = TO_DATE(date_orig, 'DD/MM/YYYY');
```
<br>
<br>

### PART B. Data exploration: Questions

<br>

**Question 1:** Determine COVID infection rates (Total cases vs population, or the percentage of population that contracted COVID19) worldwide, by country, by continent. Show the highest or top 10. 

```sql
-- create a view for the infection rates
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW infectionRates 
AS
SELECT 
	continent,
	location,
	reporting_date,
	population,
	total_cases,
	ROUND(CAST(total_cases AS DECIMAL) / population * 100, 2) AS percent_population_infected
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE total_cases IS NOT NULL;
```
<br>

```sql
-- Q1a: Latest worldwide infection rates
SELECT 
	location,
	population,
	MAX(total_cases) AS total_infection_count,
	MAX(ROUND(CAST(total_cases AS DECIMAL) / population * 100, 2)) AS percent_population_infected

WHERE location = 'World'
GROUP BY location, population;
